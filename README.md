## NumberPairs

[`NumberPairs.lean`](/LeanDoodles/NumberPairs.lean)

A *Number Pair* for a given $d \in \mathbb{N}$ is a pair of numbers $(a, b)$ such that $b - a = d$ and the sum of the digits of $a$ is equal to the sum of the digits of $b$.

This module contains a constructive proof that a Number Pair exists if and only if $d$ is divisible by $9$.
